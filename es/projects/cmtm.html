        <h2 class = "cream">I was asked by the Christian Ministry Training Mission to develop a website.</h2>
        <p>In the Fall of 2023, the Christian Ministry Training Mission (CMTM) asked me to create a website for them that would showcase their <span class = "b">work</span>, <span class = "b">goals</span>, and <span class = "b">serve as a general hub</span> for people to get in contact with them. Prior, they had no website, and lacked a way to showcase their mission or recruit more missionaries.</p>
        <p>Given this objective, I created an <span class = "b">interactive website</span> that featured an informative and graphically saturated homepage, an in-depth about page, as well as a gallery of photos and collection of music. The website also features a <span class = "b">language option</span> to switch between traditional <span class = "b">Mandarin</span> and <span class = "b">English</span>, as the majority of the missionaries who work for the ministry, as well as the targeted audience, are either <span class = "b">fluent speakers</span> or <span class = "b">immigrants</span> from a speaking country. Knowing that the targeted audcience was in the older generations, the website was designed to be easy to navigate and user-friendly.</p>
        <p>For this project I studied other popular ministry websites to gauge what the most common and effective formatting would be. Constructing this site was relatively easy with little-to-no bumps, but I had to come up with a way to integrate <span class = "b">two languages</span>. All the methods that I had seen online seemed excessive and to be too much work, as well as making the HTML code look messy with two copies of it laid out in the same document. Given this, I decided to integrate the two languages by having a button that would <span class = "b">navigate to another directory</span> storing the files written in Mandarin.</p>
        <br>
        <p style = "color:white; font-weight: bold;">If you'd like to view the project yourself, I have uploaded the code to a GitHub repository linked <a class = "link" href = "https://github.com/logancalder/SJCA-Website" target = "_blank" style = "color:aquamarine">here</a>.</p>
        <p style = "color:white; font-weight: bold;"><i>The website is still being published, but I will link to it as soon as it is live!</i></p>
