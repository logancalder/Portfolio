        <h2 class = "hpe">This past summer I interned at Hewlett Packard Enterprises as a Software Engineer.</h2>
        <p>I had the pleasure of getting to learn from some of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) best engineers during <span class = "g">Summer 2023</span>. I worked under <span class = "g">Aruba Network</span>'s division at the office, resolving <span class = "g">bugs</span> and developing a <span class = "g">fullstack developer tool</span> that would greatly cut down time to obtain device IDs.</p>
        <p>My time at HPE was generally split into two projects as mentioned above. My first two months were spent <span class = "g"></span>resolving bugs that were plaguing tools used to <span class = "g">troubleshoot device connections</span>, whereas my last two months were spent working on a fullstack developer application that permitted employees to obtain valuable information  on device IDs. This tool would go on to be used by over <span class = "g">100 developers</span>, <span class = "g">quality assurance</span> and <span class = "g">sales engineers</span>, and <span class = "g">customer service representatives</span>.</p>
        <p>At HPE, I learned an incredible amount of new information and skills. During my work, I picked up <span class = "g">GoLang</span>, <span class = "g">Docker</span>, <span class = "g">Kubernetes</span>, <span class = "g">JavaScript</span>, and improved my <span class = "g">Python</span>, <span class = "g">HTML</span>, and <span class = "g">CSS</span> skills. I also obtained a strong grasp on the <span class = "g">Linux</span> terminal and <span class = "g">Git</span>, which I had hardly any experience working with prior. These tools and skills have become an <span class = "g">integral</span> part of my programming academics and personal projects, having used most of these since concluding my internship.</p>
        <p>My experience at HPE was <span class = "g">extremely valuable</span> and I had an amazing time working at the office. I made some new friends who I am still in contact with, and got to experience what Software Engineering was truly like in the <span class = "g">industry</span>. I even got to participate in some fun activities outside of work that were planned for the interns, such as Top Golf and pool games. Overall, it was an <span class = "g">amazing experience</span> that I would not trade in for anything else.</p>
        <p>I also recieved a <span class = "g">return offer</span> that I accepted for <span class = "g">Summer 2024</span>, so I will be making another post regarding what I accomplish next year!</p>
