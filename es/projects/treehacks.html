        <h2 class = "treehacks">I was a nominee a Repl.it's award at Stanford's 2023 Treehacks Hackathon!</h2>
        <p>In <span class="teal">February of 2023</span>, I was invited to compete at <span class="teal">Treehacks</span>, <span class="teal">Stanford</span>'s annual Hackathon. Along with a team of <span class="teal">3 others</span>, with two of us attending our first Hackathon, we created a <span class="teal">smart AI shopping assistant</span> utilizing <span class="teal">OpenAI</span>'s JavaScript API.</p>
        <p>My contribution to the project was a <span class="teal">user-friendly UI</span> which the user could converse with the bot. I also created a sales presentation which we used to pitch our product to judges, includes representatives from <span class="teal">OpenAI</span>, <span class="teal">Google</span>, and <span class="teal">Repl.it</span>. My work was entirely <span class="teal">frontend</span>, being a <span class="teal">user-friendly chatbox</span> to give OpenAI's API prompts and recieve responses.
            The purpose of this work was to make asking questions as <span class="teal">simple and straight-forward</span> as possible for the customer.
        </p>
        <p>My work features a <span class="teal">button</span> that appears in the bottom right of the client's screen. When clicked on, a <span class="teal">retractable chatbox</span> expands to fill 
            the right half of the screen. Here, the user may ask <span class="teal">any question</span> regarding a product on the website.
        Any question that is "undefined" or an empty string will not cause the AI to respond. Only when a <span class="teal">valid input</span> is provided, the AI will respond,
            creating a <span class="teal">new reponse textbox</span> with a respective profile picture. Messages may be sent with the <span class="teal">send button</span>, and the chatbox may be closed with the <span class="teal">close button</span>.</p>
        <p>Prior to the event, I had <span class="teal">no team or knowledge</span> of what a <span class="teal">Hackathon</span> would be like. I was very <span class="teal">excited</span>, but admittedly nervous. Around two weeks before the start date, I began reaching out to fellow hackers. Together, we managed to form a <span class="teal">team of 4</span> from across
            the country, with none of us having met before. It also happened to be one of my <span class="teal">fellow teammates first Hackathon</span> as well!
        <p>
        <p>We went through many ideas and subjects of which to code, but finally settled on a <span class="teal">Smart AI</span> that could effectively <span class="teal">eliminate the need
            for customer support</span>. The program would utilize <span class="teal">OpenAI's API</span>, and would have its own website to demonstrate both the <span class="teal">administrative and customer experience</span>.
        <p>
        <p>With Treehacks being <span class="teal">36 hours</span>, we set to work right away. One of my teammates, <span class="teal">Adi</span>, focused on the <span class="teal">backend features</span> and figured out how to
            train OpenAI's API with custom data. He then focused on how to <span class="teal">permit the AI to provide for that data</span>. My other two teammates, <span class="teal">Alyssa</span> and <span class="teal">Sabrina</span>, focused on creating the <span class="teal">frontend homepage</span> of the website, with a <span class="teal">navigation bar</span> and <span class="teal">displayable
            product lists</span>.<p>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, I focused on creating the <span class="teal">actual interface</span> that the user could <span class="teal">discuss with the bot inside of</span>. Fortunately, after over 20 hours of straight coding---and much testing---our <span class="teal">program came to life</span> after linking our code.
        <p>We were even <span class="teal">nominated for Repl'it's award</span> of the best usage of their platform, but unfortuntately did not win. Better luck next time ;)</p>
