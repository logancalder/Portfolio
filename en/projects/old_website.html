        <h2 class = "oldweb">This HTML project was my old website that has since been replaced by the one you are on now.</h2>
        <p>What you see here is what this website used to be, from <span class = "ws">2020-2024</span>. This was my first HTML project, from which I learned the core basics of frontend web-design and UI interface. While not extremely pretty, I had created this website <span class = "ws">entirely</span> on my own, without the help or contribution of anybody else. Just <span class = "ws">me</span>, some <span class = "ws">YouTube</span>, and <span class = "ws">10 hours</span> of my time. From there, the website grew to feature new projects & update my work experience.</p>
        <p>I had wanted something that <span class = "ws">stood out</span>, something that made me unique. In a world of endless software engineers and developers, a resume simply does not set you apart from the rest of the crowd anymore. Knowing this, I wanted a <span class = "ws">flashy</span> way to display my past <span class = "ws">work</span>, <span class = "ws">skills</span>, and <span class = "ws">other information</span> about me.</p>
        <p>I drew inspiration from <span class = "ws">iuri.is</span> (you can find his work linked <a class = "link" href = "https://iuri.is" target = "_blank" style = "color:#759ee6; font-weight: bold;">here</a>). Studying his HTML & CSS writing (using the <span class = "ws">inspect</span> feature on a browser), I picked up on formatting and styling techniques that were at the time foreign to me. Inserting these into my own work, the website slowly began to take shape.</p>
        <p>I also learned how to write HTML & CSS from <span class = "ws">W3Schools</span>, a great resource, and <span class = "ws">StackOverflow</span>. ChatGPT wasn't yet around at the time that I created this site, so that tool was not put into usage for this project.</p>
        <br>
        <p style = "color:white; font-weight: bold;">If you'd like to view the project yourself, I have uploaded the code to a GitHub repository linked <a class = "link" href = "https://github.com/logancalder/Website" target = "_blank" style = "color:#759ee6">here</a>.</p>
